# 🩺 PulseVaani – Your AI Health Companion

### *“Connecting patients and doctors with empathy through AI.”*

---

## 🌐 Project Overview

**PulseVaani** is a bilingual (Hindi + English) AI-powered health companion web app designed to make healthcare **accessible, empathetic, and intelligent** for everyone — especially **elderly and rural populations** in India.

It combines **AI health prediction**, **real-time vitals tracking**, and a **bilingual voice assistant ("Dock")** to bridge the gap between patients and doctors through technology that speaks their language.

Developed for **HackX MUJ 2025**, this project represents innovation in healthcare accessibility, human–AI interaction, and inclusive design.

## 💡 Problem Statement

In India, many users — especially elders and non-English speakers — struggle with complex health apps and lack real-time support for their vitals.
There’s a need for a **simple, bilingual, voice-enabled platform** that provides predictive insights, reduces hospital dependency, and empowers patients.

---

## ✅ Our Solution

**PulseVaani** simplifies digital healthcare through:

* 🧠 **AI Health Prediction:** Uses ML models (IsolationForest & Logistic Regression) to analyze vitals and detect potential risks.
* 💬 **Bilingual Voice Assistant ("Dock"):** Understands and speaks in Hindi & English with empathetic tone and natural flow.
* 🩺 **Patient Dashboard:** Displays live vitals, predictions, and guidance.
* 👨‍⚕️ **Doctor Dashboard:** Provides alerts, trend charts, and risk-based prioritization.
* 🌍 **Accessibility:** Lightweight, responsive, and optimized for rural internet speeds.

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture

**Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS (Green–White medical theme)
**Backend:** Flask / Node.js (API + AI model integration)
**Database:** Firebase / MongoDB
**AI Models:** Scikit-learn (IsolationForest, Logistic Regression)
**Voice Engine:** Web Speech API / gTTS
**Hosting:** Firebase Hosting / Render / Vercel

---

### 🔄 How It Works

1. **Patient Registration** → Syncs IoT device / manually enters vitals
2. **AI Analysis** → Model predicts health risk (e.g., cardiac, BP, sugar)
3. **Voice Feedback** → Dock gives bilingual voice alerts & guidance
4. **Doctor Dashboard** → Updates in real-time with charts & alerts
